          Hello, I go by Noodles and I am a developer of websites, apps, games, and other software. Besides, I am a translator and privacy advocate (hence I don't use my real name).<br/><br/>
          This website is mainly for showing my portfolio but I also want to use my skills to help businesses and people like you to create or update your website.<br/><br/>
          Interested? Have a look at my portfolio below and get in touch with me.
